# US-Accidents-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project

Introduction:
In today's data-driven world, understanding and harnessing the insights embedded in vast datasets are key elements of informed decision-making. One such dataset of significant interest is the "US Accidents" dataset, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset aggregates information about traffic accidents across the United States, offering a comprehensive overview of various factors contributing to road incidents. While it is not possible to predict accidents, it is quite useful to analyze the conditions under which they happen. It will be helpful to have an overview of the conditions that are controllable.

Problem Statement:
The primary objective of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project is to delve into the US Accidents dataset and unearth valuable insights that can aid in improving road safety measures. By meticulously analyzing the wealth of information contained in the dataset.
